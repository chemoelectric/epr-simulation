=epr-simulation=

An R⁷RS Scheme toolkit for constructing fully ‘local realistic’
simulations of EPR-B experiments. It is donated to the public domain.

The linear state space representation employed in quantum mechanics is
primarily a limited and obfuscated way to keep track of probability
theory calculations. ''It has no physical meaning.'' Here we do the
same calculations straightforwardly and, in this case, much more
easily and comprehensibly.

(''Note: Below appear the names of 2022 Nobel Prize winners in Physics. Despite the Nobel Prize, the physics for which it was awarded is wrong. This toolkit is to help you construct simulations that prove it is wrong.'')

== This toolkit versus widespread beliefs ==

Widespread belief in physics (in 2023) is that experiments of the type
conducted by Alain Aspect are distinctly ‘quantum’ and distinct from
‘classical’ physics. There is supposed to be an ‘entangled pair’
rather than distinct particles, and ‘instantaneous action at a
distance’ resulting in distinct particles.

All of this is easily proven false, for instance empirically by
simulations constructed using this toolkit.

Widespread belief is not evidence in favor of a theory. Belief in
orthodoxy is not scientific method, it is deference to authority. To
conduct experiments by writing simulations is an example of scientific
method.

Another example of scientific method is to make solid logical
arguments, such as the following.

== The impossibility of ‘irreducibility’ ==

That there is no ‘quantum’ physics distinct from physics generally can
actually be shown ''logically'' by the following argument&mdash;

Once a ''physics'' problem is put into words, it becomes a word
problem in ''mathematics''. It is no longer in the realm of
physics. As ''mathematics'', the problem is subject to the principles
of ''that'' field of study. One of those principles is that
mathematics has no fixed subject matter. Any problem in mathematics
can be translated into an endless number of problems concerning
different topics. Furthermore, any method used to solve a problem must
arrive at the same conclusion as any other.

Thus a problem in ‘quantum’ physics can be converted to, say, a
problem about Girl Scouts delivering cookies to their customers, or a
problem about radio signals, or a problem about abstract symbols. The
new problem may be a contrived one, but the conversion ''can'' be
done. Also, any method used to solve the problem ''must'' arrive at
the same result as does quantum mechanics, if the solution by quantum
mechanics were itself correct.

The supposed ‘irreducibility’ of ‘quantum’ physics is not merely
false: it is a firmly logical impossibility.

Thus, in the published papers (such as those by J. S. Bell, John
Clauser, etc.) where a ‘local realistic’ solution for EPR-B
correlations is reached that is different from what quantum mechanics
gives, the authors ''definitely'' have made errors. There is not the
least doubt about it, because the solution from quantum mechanics
''is'' correct.

I will prove that below, by deriving the same expression ''without''
using quantum mechanics.

== The correlation coefficient of the two-channel optical Bell test ==

=== Photons ===

I shall model the light as particles, called ‘photons’. Each photon is
plane-polarized at angle 0 or ''&pi;''/2, but we will call the first
case '''H''' for horizontal and the latter '''V''' for vertical. This
notation makes the mathematics easier to read. The photons are
generated in complementary pairs, polarized thus:
('''H''',&thinsp;'''V''') or ('''V''',&thinsp;'''H''').

Let the left side be indexed 1 and the right side indexed 2, in
whatever follows. So one might write

{|
|(photon<sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;photon<sub>2</sub>)&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;{('''H''',&thinsp;'''V'''),&thinsp;('''V''',&thinsp;'''H''')}
|}

=== Two-channel polarizers ===

The intensity of the light in a polarizer’s channel, by the Law of
Malus, is inferred to be the probability of a photon being
retransmitted into that channel. Mathematical consistency requires
this inference. The same probability may be deduced from quantum
mechanics.

Let the angle setting of the polarizer by ''&phi;''. Then the
probability of a photon being retransmitted into the '''(+)''' channel
is cos²(''&phi;'') for an '''H''' photon or sin²(''&phi;'') for a
'''V''' photon, and into the '''(&minus;)''' channel is sin²(''&phi;'') for
an '''H''' photon or cos²(''&phi;'') for a '''V''' photon.

=== Removing one of the polarizers from the problem ===

Let us set the left and right side polarizers respectively to
''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;&real; and
''&phi;''<sub>02</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0. In that case on the right
side every '''H''' photon is retransmitted into the '''(+)''' channel
and every '''V''' photon into the '''(&minus;)''' channel. Thus we can
ignore that there is a polarizing beam splitter on that side, and
simply map

{|
|'''H'''&thinsp;↦'''(+)'''
|-
|'''V'''&thinsp;↦'''(&minus;)'''
|}

Assign the value +1 to a photon detected in a '''(+)''' channel and
&minus;1 to a photon detected in a '''(&minus;)''' channel. This
choice of values makes the correlation coefficient equal the
covariance. That is, no normalization is needed. It can be computed
(with some care) as follows&mdash;

{|
|''&rho;'' = ''&rho;''<sup>++</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>+&minus;</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>&minus;+</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>&minus;&minus;</sup>
|}

where

{|
|''&rho;''<sup>++</sup> = &frac12;(+1)(+1)&thinsp;sin²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>+&minus;</sup> = &frac12;(+1)(&minus;1)&thinsp;cos²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>&minus;+</sup> = &frac12;(&minus;1)(+1)&thinsp;cos²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>&minus;&minus;</sup> = &frac12;(&minus;1)(&minus;1)&thinsp;sin²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>
|}

Using a double-angle identity, and taking advantage of
''&phi;''<sub>02</sub> being equal to zero, this becomes

{|
|''&rho;'' || = &minus;(cos²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub> &minus; sin²''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>)
|-
|&nbsp;    || = &minus;cos&thinsp;2''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>
|-
|&nbsp;    || = &minus;cos&thinsp;2(''&phi;''<sub>01</sub> &minus; ''&phi;''<sub>02</sub>)
|}

In the last expression,
''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''&phi;''<sub>02</sub> is the
difference between the two settings. It would appear that the
correlation coefficient is invariant with respect to changes in the
actual angles, as long as this difference is maintained.

Let us make the invariance more formal.  Let
&Delta;''&phi;''&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;&real;,
''&phi;''<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>&thinsp;+&thinsp;&Delta;''&phi;'',
and
''&phi;''<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;''&phi;''<sub>02</sub>&thinsp;+&thinsp;&Delta;''&phi;''&thinsp;=&thinsp;&Delta;''&phi;''.
Clearly ''&phi;''<sub>1</sub> and ''&phi;''<sub>2</sub> can be any
angle settings of the polarizers:
''&phi;''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''&phi;''<sub>2</sub> =
(''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;&thinsp;&Delta;''&phi;'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(''&phi;''<sub>02</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;&thinsp;&Delta;''&phi;'') =
''&phi;''<sub>01</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''&phi;''<sub>02</sub> is
their difference, and &Delta;''&phi;'' is a shared rotational
offset.

=== The general solution, derived without quantum mechanics ===

Thus the general formula for the correlation coefficient is

{|
|''&rho;'' = &minus;cos&thinsp;2(''&phi;''<sub>1</sub> &minus; ''&phi;''<sub>2</sub>)
|}

for any
''&phi;''<sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;''&phi;''<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;&real;.

This result is the same as that obtained by quantum mechanics. It had
to be: all mathematical methods, applied to the same problem, must
reach the same result.

Physicists compute this function ''only'' by quantum mechanics, call
it ‘quantum correlation’, and think it peculiarly ‘quantum’. However,
let us suppose they had noticed you could rotate the polarizing beam
splitter (PBS) settings together, without affecting the correlation,
so that one of the PBS was at zero degrees. Then they could have
worked backwards and found the derivation given above. They would thus
have proven that ‘quantum correlation’ is in fact simply the
‘correlation’ and that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were correct.
