epr-simulation

A Scheme toolkit for constructing fully ‘local realistic’ simulations
of EPR-B experiments. It is donated to the public domain.

The orthodox belief in physics (in 2023) is that experiments of the
type conducted by 2022 Nobel laureate Alain Aspect are distinctly
‘quantum’ and prove the existence of this distinction from ‘classical’
physics. There is supposed to be a kind of ‘entanglement’ rather than
distinct particles, and action at a distance that resolves the
‘entanglement’ into distinct particles.

All of this is easily proven to be nonsense, for instance empirically
by simulations constructed using this toolkit.

That the nonsense is held true by the orthodoxy is not evidence in its
favor. Unquestionably it is evidence of a social psychological
disorder.

That there actually is no ‘quantum’ physics distinct from physics
generally is easily shown by the following argument—

Once a physics problem is put into words, it becomes a ''word problem
in mathematics''.
