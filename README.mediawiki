=epr-simulation=

A Scheme toolkit for constructing fully ‘local realistic’ simulations
of EPR-B experiments. It is donated to the public domain.

The orthodox belief in physics (in 2023) is that experiments of the
type conducted by 2022 Nobel laureate Alain Aspect are distinctly
‘quantum’ and prove the existence of this distinction from ‘classical’
physics. There is supposed to be a kind of ‘entanglement’ rather than
distinct particles, and action at a distance that resolves the
‘entanglement’ into distinct particles.

All of this is easily proven to be nonsense, for instance empirically
by simulations constructed using this toolkit.

That the nonsense is held true by the orthodoxy is not evidence in its
favor. Unquestionably it is evidence of a social psychological
disorder.

That there actually is no ‘quantum’ physics distinct from physics
generally is easily shown by the following argument—

Once a ''physics'' problem is put into words, it becomes a word
problem in ''mathematics''. It is no longer in the realm of
physics. As ''mathematics'', the problem is subject to the rules of
''that'' field of study. One of those is that mathematics has no fixed
subject matter. Any problem in mathematics can be translated into an
infinity of different problems concerning different
topics. Furthermore, any method used to solve the problem must arrive
at the same conclusion as any other.

Thus a problem in ‘quantum’ physics can be converted to, say, a
problem about Girl Scouts delivering cookies to their customers. The
new problem may be a contrived one, but the conversion ''can'' be
done. Also, any method used to solve the problem must arrive at the
same result as does quantum mechanics, if the solution by quantum
mechanics be correct. In published papers where a different solution
is reached (J.S. Bell, John Clauser, etc.), the authors have made
mathematical errors.
