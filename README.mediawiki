=epr-simulation=

A Scheme toolkit for constructing fully ‘local realistic’ simulations
of EPR-B experiments. It is donated to the public domain.

== This toolkit versus the orthodoxy ==

The orthodox belief in physics (in 2023) is that experiments of the
type conducted by 2022 Nobel laureate Alain Aspect are distinctly
‘quantum’ and prove the existence of this distinction from ‘classical’
physics. There is supposed to be a kind of ‘entanglement’ rather than
distinct particles, and action at a distance that resolves the
‘entanglement’ into distinct particles.

All of this is easily proven to be nonsense, for instance empirically
by simulations constructed using this toolkit.

That the nonsense is held true by the orthodoxy is not evidence in its
favor. Unquestionably it is evidence of a social psychological
disorder.

== The impossibility of ‘irreducibility’ ==

That there actually is no ‘quantum’ physics distinct from physics
generally is easily shown by the following argument—

Once a ''physics'' problem is put into words, it becomes a word
problem in ''mathematics''. It is no longer in the realm of
physics. As ''mathematics'', the problem is subject to the rules of
''that'' field of study. One of those is that mathematics has no fixed
subject matter. Any problem in mathematics can be translated into an
endless number of problems concerning different topics. Furthermore,
any method used to solve a problem must arrive at the same conclusion
as any other.

Thus a problem in ‘quantum’ physics can be converted to, say, a
problem about Girl Scouts delivering cookies to their customers. The
new problem may be a contrived one, but the conversion ''can'' be
done. Also, any method used to solve the problem must arrive at the
same result as does quantum mechanics, if the solution by quantum
mechanics be correct. In published papers where a different solution
is reached (J.S. Bell, John Clauser, etc.), the authors have made
mathematical errors.

The supposed ‘irreducibility’ of ‘quantum’ physics is not merely
false, but a logical impossibility.

However, to comprehend this fact requires a competence in logical
inference that our universities do not bestow upon their
students. Instead they teach students not to question whatever is
orthodox, even if they happen to know with logical certainty that the
orthodoxy is wrong.

== The correlation coefficient of the two-channel optical Bell test ==

Here I shall prove logically that the two-channel optical Bell test,
of the kind conducted by Alain Aspect in the early 1980s, is not
‘quantum’. It is not even ‘statistical mechanical’. It is not even
‘standing waves’, as apparently some have tried to model it. It is
merely pulses of light moving through polarizers.

=== Photons ===

I shall model the light as particles, called ‘photons’. Each photon is
plane-polarized at angle 0 or ''&pi;''/2, but we will call the first
case '''H''' for horizontal and the latter '''V''' for vertical. This
notation makes the mathematics easier to read. The photons are
generated in complementary pairs, polarized thus:
('''H''',&thinsp;'''V''') or ('''V''',&thinsp;'''H''').

Let the left side be indexed 1 and the right side indexed 2, in
whatever follows. So one might write

{|
|(photon<sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;photon<sub>2</sub>)&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;{('''H''',&thinsp;'''V'''),&thinsp;('''V''',&thinsp;'''H''')}
|}

=== Two-channel polarizers ===

The intensity of the light in a polarizer’s channel, by the Law of
Malus, is inferred to be the probability of a photon being
retransmitted into that channel. Mathematical consistency requires
this inference.

Let the angle setting of the polarizer by ''&phi;''. Then the
probability of a photon being retransmitted into the '''(+)''' channel
is cos²(''&phi;'') for an '''H''' photon or sin²(''&phi;'') for a
'''V''' photon, and into the '''(-)''' channel is sin²(''&phi;'') for
an '''H''' photon or cos²(''&phi;'') for a '''V''' photon.

=== Removing one of the polarizers from the problem ===

Let us set the left and right side polarizers respectively to
''&phi;<sub>01</sub>''&isin;&real; and ''&phi;''<sub>02</sub>=0. In
that case on the right side every '''H''' photon is retransmitted into
the '''(+)''' channel and every '''V''' photon into the the '''(-)'''
channel. Thus we can ignore that there is a beam-splitting polarizer
on that side, and simply map

{|
|'''H'''&thinsp;↦'''(+)'''
|-
|'''V'''&thinsp;↦'''(-)'''
|}

Assign the value +1 to a photon detected in a '''(+)''' channel and -1
to a photon detected in a '''(-)''' channel. This choice of values
makes the correlation coefficient equal the covariance. That is, no
normalization is needed. It can be computed as follows&mdash;

{|
|''&rho;'' = ''&rho;''<sup>++</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>+-</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>-+</sup> + ''&rho;''<sup>--</sup>
|}

where

{|
|''&rho;''<sup>++</sup> = &frac12;(+1)(+1)&thinsp;sin²''&phi;<sub>01</sub>''
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>+-</sup> = &frac12;(+1)(-1)&thinsp;cos²''&phi;<sub>01</sub>''
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>-+</sup> = &frac12;(-1)(+1)&thinsp;cos²''&phi;<sub>01</sub>''
|-
|''&rho;''<sup>--</sup> = &frac12;(-1)(-1)&thinsp;sin²''&phi;<sub>01</sub>''
|}
